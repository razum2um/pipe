# Pipe

A developer-happiness tool, which allows you to write "middlewares for data" in request-response cycle

## Usage

Assume we have some web service (assume SOAP like this: `http://wsf.cdyne.com/WeatherWS/Weather.asmx?WSDL`)

And we have a client which sends a compressed request:

    <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:weat="http://ws.cdyne.com/WeatherWS/"><soapenv:Header/><soapenv:Body><weat:GetCityWeatherByZIP><weat:ZIP>10007</weat:ZIP></weat:GetCityWeatherByZIP></soapenv:Body></soapenv:Envelope>

Now we want:

- debug requests and responses
- cache responses for identical requests for rapid development

It can be achieved like this:

    user=> (pipe.core/start "wsf.cdyne.com" [(partial pipe.core/pretty-xml 4) (pipe.core/prefix-log "Formatted:")])

This launches proxy on `localhost:8080` and calling same action with same payload will log request and response with proper indent and also cache identical queries

            </weat:GetCityWeatherByZIP>
        </soapenv:Body>
    </soapenv:Envelope>

            </GetCityWeatherByZ...

What happened:

- request was piped through a middleware `pipe.core/pretty-xml` which intends it
- request went throgh `pipe.core/prefix-log` which dumped pretty request truncated as above

- pretty request went to the webservice

- response was piped through a middleware `pipe.core/pretty-xml` which intends it
- response went throgh `pipe.core/prefix-log` which dumped pretty response truncated as above

Beware, the proxy server is asynchronous and in the end proxy can be stopped like this:

    user=> (pipe.core/stop)

## Middlewares

A middleware is a vector of 2 functions the first is applied to the request, the second to the response.

If you'd like to modify only the response you can use `[identity response-fn]`
or a helper `(pipe.core/response-chain response-fn)`

Same for middlewares for only requests: `[request-fn identity]` or `(pipe.core/request-chain response-fn)`

Middlewares are appried left-to-right as they follow in the list.

A middleware can be a function alone - in thos case it gets applied to both request and response
